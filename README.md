A free and open source resume builder.
## how to use？
 - You only need to enter the md format of your resume in the editing area, and then you can see the effect in the preview area. After editing your resume, you only need to click the download button in the upper right corner to preview and download it in pdf format. 
 - If you are not particularly satisfied with the previewed pdf format, for example, a certain part of the content is divided due to pagination. At this time, you can click on the preview area at the beginning, and you will find that it is editable, which means that you can modify some formats here, and then click the download button, and you will find that your modified content will be applied to the pdf superior. 
 - Note: The content edited in the preview area cannot adversely affect the editing area. At the same time, if the content of the editing area is modified, the previously modified content in the preview area will be invalid.
